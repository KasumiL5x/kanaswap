I want to have click->click to swap like in Bejewled, but that obviously breaks the click to open the stroke preview.  My idea to solve this is to have the click->click system in place, and have a button such as "Strokes" or whatever, that can be clicked to view the stroke once one is selected.  It may be confusing for the user if they want to click on different ones to view them (as it would switch them).  Maybe some kind of timeout or whatnot?
